# Byte Me! - Food Ordering System
Byte Me! is a CLI-based Food Ordering System, which manages and facilitates Customer and Admin(Staff) operations. I made this application as a part of my Advanced Programming Course

## Assumptions
### Food Items
- Prices of food items are taken to be integers(not floating point numbers)
- Name of food item cannot be changed
- By default, an item is available

### Admin
- Password for all admins is "a"

### Customer
- I am identifying customers by their names, so the names should be unique. They should be treated as usernames.
